                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Introduction
                        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and
                        lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can
                        be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                        <br>
                        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core
                        set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core
                        JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional
                        objects; for example:
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a
                                browser
                                and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an
                                application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as
                                mouse
                                clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to
                                running
                                JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to
                                communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation
                                to
                                another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>
                        JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                        JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type
                        checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
                        control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                        JavaScript.

                        <br>
                        JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
                        variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are
                        public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                        parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                    <h3>Variables</h3>
                    <p>
                        You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables,
                        called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                        <br>
                        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($);
                        subsequent
                        characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include
                        the
                        characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                        <br>
                        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use
                        the
                        Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                        Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

                    <h3>Declaring Variables</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can declare a variable in three ways:
                        With the keyword var. For example,
                        <br>
                        <code>
                            var x = 42.
                        </code>
                        <br>
                        This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                        <br>
                        By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                        <br>
                        <code>
                            x = 42.
                        </code>
                        <br>
                        This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You
                        shouldn't
                        use this variant.
                        <br>
                        With the keyword let. For example,
                        <br>
                        <code>
                            let y = 13.
                        </code>
                        <br>
                        This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section id="variable-scope" class="main-section">
                    <h3>Variable scope</h3>
                    <p>
                        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because
                        it
                        is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a
                        function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
                        <br>
                        JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable
                        declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides
                        within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function
                        (or
                        global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if
                        statement.
                        <br>
                        <code>
                        if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
                    </code>
                        <br>
                        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
                        <br>
                        <code>

                        if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                        defined
                        </code>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Global variables</h3>
                    <p>
                        Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object
                        is
                        window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
                        <br>

                        Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another
                        window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called
                        phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
                        parent.phoneNumber.

                    <h3>
                        Constants
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant
                        identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore
                        or
                        dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.

                        <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                        <br>
                        A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is
                        running.
                        It has to be initialized to a value.
                        <br>

                        The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the
                        const
                        keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
                        <br>
                        You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same
                        scope.
                        For example:
                        <br>
                        <code>
                        // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                        CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                        }
                        </code>
                        <br>
                        However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without
                        problems.

                        Data types
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
                            <li>
                                Six data types that are primitives:
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive,
                                null is not
                                the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                            </li>
                            <li>and Object</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful
                        functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements
                        in
                        the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
                        procedures that your application can perform.

                    <p>
                        Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional
                        else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as
                        follows:
                        <br>
                        <code>
                        if (condition) { statement_1; }<br> else { statement_2; }
                    </code>
                        <br>
                        condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an
                        explanation
                        of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is
                        executed;
                        otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
                        including
                        further nested if statements.
                        <br>
                        You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in
                        sequence, as follows:
                        <br>
                        <code>
                        if (condition_1) { statement_1; }<br>else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                        }<br> else if (condition_n) { statement_n; }<br> else { statement_last; }    
                    </code>
                        <br>
                        In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true
                        will
                        be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) .
                        In
                        general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if
                        statements:
                        <br>
                        <code>
                        if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; }<br> else {
                            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                            statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }        
                    </code>
                        <br>
                        It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the
                        assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not
                        use
                        the following code:
                        <br>
                        <code>
                        if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }
                    </code>
                        <br>
                        If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
                        additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
                        <br>
                        <code>

                        if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }
                        </code>
                    </p>

                <section id="while" class="main-section">
                    <h3>while Statement</h3>
                    <p>
                        A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to
                        true. A while statement looks as follows:
                        <br>
                        <code>
                            while (condition) statement
                        </code>
                        <br>
                        If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes
                        to the statement following the loop.
                        <br>
                        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns
                        true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns
                        false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
                        <br>
                        To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
                        <br>
                        Example:
                        <br>
                        The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
                        <br>
                        <code>var n = 0; var x = 0;<br> while (n &lt 3) { n++; x +=n; }</code><br>
                        With each iteration, the loop increments
                        n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values: After the
                        first pass: n=1 and x=1 After the second pass: n=2 and x=3 After the third pass: n=3 and
                        x=6 After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt 3 is no longer true, so the loop
                        terminates. </p>

                    <h3>Function declarations</h3>
                    <p>
                        A function definition (also called a function
                        declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The name of the function.</li>
                            <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                                separated by commas.</li>
                            <li>
                                The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
                                curly brackets, { }.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        For example, the following code defines a simple function named
                        square:
                        <br>
                        <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
                        <br>
                        The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one
                        statement that says to
                        return
                        the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
                        statement specifies the value returned by the function.
                        <br>
                        <code>return number * number;</code>
                        <br>
                        Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value
                        is
                        passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this
                        change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.
